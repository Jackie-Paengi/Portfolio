            <h3>About Jackson Lolkipayangi</h3>
            <p>Hello! My name is Jackson Lolkipayang, and I’m an IT professional with a deep passion for problem-solving, technology, and community-driven initiatives. My story is one of curiosity, resilience, and a steadfast commitment to continuous learning. I have always believed that technology is not just about machines and software, but about the people who use it. From my earliest interactions with computers to the complex systems I now manage, my career has been shaped by a desire to make technology work for everyone, regardless of background or circumstance.

                Born and raised in Samburu County, Land of milk and honey. I grew up surrounded by vast landscapes and a community rich in cultural traditions. It was here that I learned the importance of collaboration, hard work, and giving back to the community—values that have guided me throughout my life. My upbringing instilled in me a deep appreciation for how technology can bridge gaps, bring people closer, and create opportunities for growth and development.</p>

            <h2>Education: Building the Foundation</h2>
            <p>I completed my formal education with a focus on Information and Communication Technology ICT. However, I quickly realized that my learning journey was far from over. Technology is an ever-evolving field, and to stay ahead, I committed myself to lifelong learning. Over the years, I have pursued various certifications, including the Prince2 Foundation and Practitioner course, which has enabled me to manage projects effectively. These certifications are more than just qualifications—they are tools that have empowered me to understand the complexities of IT infrastructure, software systems, and the intricacies of project management.

                One of the most significant lessons I learned early in my career was that knowledge is most powerful when shared. As a result, I have always been committed to mentoring and guiding others, helping them navigate the often complex world of technology. I find immense satisfaction in seeing others succeed and knowing that I played a part in their journey.</p>

                    <p>The goal of this project was to create a professional and responsive portfolio website that showcases my skills, experience, and projects.

                    <p>In my networking projects, I gained extensive experience in setting up and maintaining network infrastructure, particularly during my time at the ICT Authority while deployed at the Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA). I was responsible for restructuring the network infrastructure by installing and terminating new RJ45 ports, trunking cables, and ensuring proper cable management for optimized performance. Additionally, I assisted in troubleshooting network connectivity issues, ensuring that staff across different departments experienced minimal downtime. These experiences have strengthened my understanding of network systems and my ability to manage and resolve complex networking challenges.</p>

                <h2>Community Involvement: Giving Back</h2>
                <p>Beyond the technical aspects of my career, I am deeply passionate about using my skills to give back to the community. I firmly believe that technology should be accessible to everyone, and I’ve been involved in numerous community-driven initiatives that focus on bridging the digital divide. One such project is the Magic Hands Project, an initiative aimed at poverty reduction by strengthening the voices of women in pastoral communities for economic self-reliance. My role was to provide technical support, ensuring that the project had the necessary IT infrastructure to facilitate communication, data collection, and coordination among team members.
